 \section*{\LARGE{Adiabatic Theorem}}
 \begin{Large}
  Let a system be in an eigenstate $\psi_n^i$ of the system. Now consider a case in which the Hamiltonian of the system starts changing in time. The adiabatic theorem states that if this change occurs slow enough, the system will remain in the $n^{th}$ eigenstate $\psi_n^i$ of the system at time t.
